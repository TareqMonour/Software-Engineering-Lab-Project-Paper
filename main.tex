\section{Introduction}
The real estate and home services industries are often fragmented, requiring users to interact with multiple platforms for property rental, purchase, service booking, and communication. This fragmentation leads to inefficiencies, security risks, and poor user experience \cite{real_estate_platforms}. NestEase addresses these challenges by providing a unified platform supporting all major user roles and workflows in the home solutions domain.

NestEase is designed to be a one-stop solution for all home-related needs, combining property management, service provision, and secure transactions. The platform is built to be modular, scalable, and user-centric, ensuring that both individual users and businesses can benefit from its features.

\section{Problem Statement}
The current real estate and home services market suffers from several critical issues:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Platform Fragmentation:} Users must navigate multiple platforms for different services (Zillow for properties, Thumbtack for services, Airbnb for rentals).
    \item \textbf{Inconsistent User Experience:} Each platform has different interfaces, authentication systems, and user workflows, leading to confusion and inefficiency.
    \item \textbf{Security Concerns:} Multiple accounts and payment systems increase security risks and data exposure.
    \item \textbf{Lack of Real-Time Communication:} Delayed notifications and communication gaps between users can result in missed opportunities and poor service.
    \item \textbf{Role Management Complexity:} Users often have multiple roles (landlord, tenant, service provider) but must manage them separately, leading to duplicated effort and data silos.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Motivation}
The motivation behind NestEase is to address these market inefficiencies and provide a seamless, secure, and scalable platform for all home-related activities. By unifying property management, service provision, and transactions, NestEase aims to:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Enhance User Experience:} Provide a single, intuitive interface for all home-related needs.
    \item \textbf{Improve Security:} Centralize authentication and payment processing to reduce risk.
    \item \textbf{Enable Real-Time Communication:} Ensure users receive instant updates and notifications.
    \item \textbf{Support Role Flexibility:} Allow users to switch roles dynamically and access different features as needed.
    \item \textbf{Facilitate Growth:} Use a modular architecture that supports future expansion and new features.
\end{itemize}

\end{tabular}
\end{table}


\subsection{Research Gap}
While there is extensive research on property management systems, service booking platforms, and payment processing \cite{real_estate_platforms}, few solutions attempt to unify these domains. Most platforms focus on a single aspect, resulting in fragmented user experiences. NestEase fills this gap by integrating all major home-related services into a single, cohesive platform.

\section{System Concept and User Flows}
NestEase is designed to support a wide range of user personas, including landlords, tenants, buyers, sellers, and service providers. Each role unlocks a unique set of features and workflows. For example, a landlord can list properties, review booking requests, and receive payments, while a tenant can search for rentals, submit applications, and communicate with property owners. Service providers can offer cleaning, repair, or moving services, and buyers and sellers can transact securely through integrated payment processing.

\subsection{User Journey: Role Switching}
A key innovation in NestEase is its dynamic role switching capability. Users can seamlessly switch between roles (e.g., from tenant to landlord) without logging out or creating separate accounts. When a user selects a new role, the backend updates their profile and issues a new JWT token. The frontend detects this change, updates the UI, and ensures that all API requests use the new token. This process is designed to be instantaneous and transparent, providing a frictionless experience for users who need to manage properties, book services, and communicate with other stakeholders—all from a single account.

\subsection{User Journey: Booking a Property}
When a tenant wants to book a property, they search for available listings using advanced filters (location, price, amenities, etc.). Upon finding a suitable property, the tenant submits a booking request. The landlord receives a real-time notification and can approve or reject the request. If approved, the tenant is prompted to complete payment via Stripe. The system updates the booking status and notifies both parties of the outcome.

\subsection{User Journey: Service Provision}
Service providers can list their offerings (e.g., cleaning, repairs) and manage bookings through a dedicated dashboard. Users can browse available services, book appointments, and leave reviews. Real-time notifications keep both providers and customers informed of booking statuses and updates.

\subsection{User Journey: Real-Time Notification System}
A key innovation in NestEase is its real-time notification system \cite{websocket_architecture}. Users receive instant updates about important events, such as booking approvals, payment confirmations, or service provider responses. This is achieved through a WebSocket gateway that pushes notifications directly to the user's browser. The frontend displays these notifications in a dedicated panel, with unread counts and the ability to mark messages as read. This enhances user engagement and reduces the risk of missed opportunities.

\section{System Architecture}
\subsection{Overview}
NestEase is structured as a client-server web application. The backend exposes RESTful and WebSocket APIs, while the frontend consumes these APIs and manages user interaction. Key modules include user management, property management, service provider management, notifications, payments, and role-based access control.

\subsection{Backend Architecture}
The backend is built using NestJS, a progressive Node.js framework that provides excellent support for building scalable server-side applications. TypeORM is used for database abstraction, enabling rapid development and easy migrations. JWT authentication ensures secure, stateless sessions, while Stripe integration provides reliable payment processing. The backend is modular, with separate modules for users, properties, bookings, notifications, and payments.

\subsection{Frontend Architecture}
The frontend leverages Next.js for server-side rendering and static site generation, ensuring fast load times and SEO optimization. React Context is used for global state management, while Tailwind CSS and Radix UI provide a modern, responsive, and accessible user interface. The frontend is designed to be mobile-first, with adaptive layouts and touch-friendly controls.

\subsection{Database Schema}
The database design supports all major entities and relationships, including users, properties, bookings, notifications, and service providers. Each table is normalized to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. Indexing and query optimization are used to ensure fast response times, even with large datasets.

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\caption{Core Database Tables}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Table} & \textbf{Purpose} & \textbf{Key Fields} \\
\hline
users & User accounts and profiles & id, email, password, role, name \\
\hline
properties & Property listings & id, title, price, location, owner\_id \\
\hline
bookings & Property bookings & id, property\_id, user\_id, status \\
\hline
notifications & User notifications & id, user\_id, message, read \\
\hline
service\_providers & Service listings & id, name, service\_type, owner\_id \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section{Feature Implementation and Workflows}
\subsection{Role-Based Access Control}
NestEase supports a diverse set of user personas, each with tailored workflows and permissions. The backend enforces role-based access using JWT authentication and custom guards \cite{role_based_access}. When a user switches roles, the backend updates their role in the database and issues a new JWT reflecting the new role. The frontend stores this token and refreshes the user context, ensuring that all subsequent API requests and UI elements reflect the new permissions. Unauthorized access to endpoints is prevented at the API level, while the UI dynamically adapts to the user's current role, showing or hiding features as appropriate.

\subsection{Property Management System}
The property management system supports comprehensive CRUD operations with advanced filtering and search capabilities. Landlords and sellers can list, update, and manage properties, while tenants and buyers can search for available listings, submit booking requests, and complete transactions. The system supports property verification, bachelor-friendly badges, and real-time status updates.

\subsection{Booking and Transaction Workflow}
The booking workflow is designed to be intuitive and secure. Tenants can search for properties, submit booking requests, and receive instant feedback. Landlords are notified in real time and can approve or reject requests. Upon approval, the tenant completes payment via Stripe, and the system updates the booking status. All parties receive notifications at each step, ensuring transparency and accountability.

\subsection{Service Provider Management}
Service providers can list their offerings, manage bookings, and communicate with customers through a dedicated dashboard. Users can browse available services, book appointments, and leave reviews. The system supports real-time notifications, status tracking, and payment processing for service bookings.

\subsection{Real-Time Notification System}
A key innovation in NestEase is its real-time notification system \cite{websocket_architecture}. Users receive instant updates about important events, such as booking approvals, payment confirmations, or responses from service providers. This is achieved through a WebSocket gateway that pushes notifications directly to the user's browser. The frontend displays these notifications in a dedicated panel, with unread counts and the ability to mark messages as read. This enhances user engagement and reduces the risk of missed opportunities.

\subsection{Payment Integration}
Stripe integration enables secure payment processing for property purchases and service bookings \cite{payment_security}. The system supports multiple payment methods, automatic payment confirmation, and real-time status updates. Payment workflows are designed to be seamless and secure, with comprehensive error handling and user feedback.

\section{Technical Implementation}
\subsection{Backend Code Examples}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TypeScript, caption=RolesGuard Implementation]
@Injectable()
export class RolesGuard implements CanActivate {
  constructor(private reflector: Reflector) {}
  canActivate(context: ExecutionContext): boolean {
    const roles = this.reflector.get<string[]>('roles', context.getHandler());
    if (!roles) return true;
    const request = context.switchToHttp().getRequest();
    const user = request.user;
    const userRole = user?.role?.toLowerCase();
    const requiredRoles = roles.map(role => role.toLowerCase());
    return requiredRoles.includes(userRole);
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=TypeScript, caption=Payment Service]
@Injectable()
export class PaymentService {
  constructor(private stripe: Stripe) {}
  async createPaymentIntent(amount: number, currency: string = 'usd') {
    return this.stripe.paymentIntents.create({
      amount,
      currency,
      automatic_payment_methods: { enabled: true },
    });
  }
  async confirmPayment(paymentIntentId: string) {
    return this.stripe.paymentIntents.confirm(paymentIntentId);
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\section{API Endpoints}
The system exposes comprehensive REST APIs for all major functionalities:

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\caption{Key API Endpoints}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
